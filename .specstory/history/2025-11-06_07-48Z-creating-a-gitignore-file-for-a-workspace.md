I'll create a `.gitignore` file for this workspace. Based on the structure, this appears to be a .NET/C# project with CodeQL analysis, so I'll include appropriate ignore patterns. Created `.gitignore` with patterns for:
- .NET build outputs (`bin/`, `obj/`)
- Visual Studio files
- NuGet packages
- CodeQL databases
- SARIF results
- Terraform state files
- OS and IDE generated files
